# Performance Evaluation of Deep Learning Model on different flavors of Linux
## Goals
This is not a project for accurate testing of deep learning models.
Goals
* Test the same deep learning model against various flavors of linux, despite how accurate the model is
* Test the time it takes for the model to train
* Test the time it takes for the model to make predictions against at least 60 images...
* Record the results, and present them
